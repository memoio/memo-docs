## Note

The following commands are executed only if the MEFS_PATH environment variable has been set to the root directory of the node, using the user as an example:

In the linux environment, the default root directory of the node is ~/.memo-user, set the root directory with the command below

```shell
MEFS_PATH=~/.memo-user
```

In the windows environment, the default root directory of the node is c:\memouser, set the root directory with the command below

```shell
set MEFS_PATH=c:\memouser
```

## Pledge operation

First check the node info panel to confirm that the current ERC20 balance is sufficient for pledging.

```
