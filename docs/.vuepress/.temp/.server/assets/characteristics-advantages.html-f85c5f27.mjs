When the target user initiates a download request, the nearest node downloads the fragments by the nearest node and provides them to the user completely. Multiple images or copies are provided throughout the network, which greatly improves the access speed and stability.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Shared globally</strong>.Multiple Memo devices can form a cluster effect to realize global data sharing, unified storage space management, and automatic load balancing of the cloud storage platform. Files can be distributed across regions and networks, supporting data storage and efficient use across the entire network , On-demand expansion to meet the needs of users for high-speed expansion.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Data security.</strong> Data storage function is the cornerstone of Memo, and data security and reliability are the cornerstones of data storage function. Memo&#39;s data privacy policy requires data at its source-the client-that is encrypted with a user key before it is written to the edge storage device. In addition, the access control mechanism ensures that the data can be accessed by its owner or its maintainer and the store in collaboration, while not being accessed by other users, or unrelated maintainers and storers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>System reliability.</strong> Memo&#39;s goal of ensuring reliability is to prevent data loss when user equipment, maintenance equipment, or edge storage equipment fails. Duplication, erasure coding, and other data redundancy technologies can be used to ensure the reliability of data stored on edge storage devices.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The original data recovery method--RAFI</strong>. In addition to data redundancy mechanisms, data repair methods are also an important factor in determining data reliability. Memo&#39;s original data recovery method RAFI is used to further improve the reliability of data stored in edge storage devices. RAFI technology can optimize the edge storage space, and more guarantee the security of data and the stability of the system. Through real-time query, data with high risk of loss can be quickly found, effectively shortening the total time of data repair and improving performance.</p><p> </p><h4 id="compared-with-other-blockchain-storage-projects-what-is-special-about-memo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compared-with-other-blockchain-storage-projects-what-is-special-about-memo" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Compared with Other Blockchain Storage Projects, What Is Special about MEMO?</h4><p>MEMO is a blockchain-based decentralized cloud storage system. It&#39;s unlike some projects aiming at producing blocks whose storage data volume is directly linked to the calculation power of blocks; it is also different from pseudo-decentralized distributed storage projects, one of whose nodes or several usually undertake the function of &#39;centralized nodes&#39;.</p></div>`);
